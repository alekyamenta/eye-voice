# creates TextGrid files in the subdirectory "textgrid" (which must be already created),
# loops through three tiers, assuming tier 1 is sentence, tier 2 is word, and tier 3 is story number 
# calculates total duration of each sound file, 
# calculates the duration of the first X interval(s) [interval 1 = onset], 
# exports story number in file
# saves results to a *.csv file.
